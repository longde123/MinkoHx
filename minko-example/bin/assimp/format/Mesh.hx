/** @brief A single face in a mesh, referring to multiple vertices.
 *
 * If mNumIndices is 3, we call the face 'triangle', for mNumIndices > 3
 * it's called 'polygon' (hey, that's just a definition!).
 * <br>
 * aiMesh::primitiveTypes can be queried to quickly examine which types of primitive are actually present in a mesh.
 * The #aiProcess_SortByPType flag executes a special post-processing algorithm which splits meshes with *different*
 * primitive types mixed up (e.g. lines and triangles) in several 'clean' submeshes. Furthermore there is a
 * configuration option ( #AI_CONFIG_PP_SBP_REMOVE) to force #aiProcess_SortByPType to remove specific kinds of
 * primitives from the imported scene, completely and forever.
 * In many cases you'll probably want to set this setting to
 * @code
 * aiPrimitiveType_LINE|aiPrimitiveType_POINT
 * @endcode
 * Together with the #aiProcess_Triangulate flag you can then be sure that #aiFace::mNumIndices is always 3.
 * @note Take a look at the @link data Data Structures page @endlink for more information on the layout and winding
 * order of a face.  */
