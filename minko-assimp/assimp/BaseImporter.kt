     * <li>the vertex data is stored in a pseudo-indexed "verbose" format.
     *  In fact this means that every vertex that is referenced by a face is unique. Or the other way round: a vertex
     *  index may not occur twice in a single AiMesh.</li>
     * <li>AiAnimation.duration may be -1. Assimp determines the length of the animation automatically in this case as
     *  the length of the longest animation channel.</li>
     * <li>AiMesh.bitangents may be null if tangents and normals are given. In this case bitangents are computed as the
     *  cross product between normal and tangent.</li>
     * <li>There needn't be a material. If none is there a default material is generated. However, it is recommended
     *  practice for loaders to generate a default material for yourself that matches the default material setting for
     *  the file format better than Assimp's generic default material. Note that default materials *should* be named
     *  AI_DEFAULT_MATERIAL_NAME if they're just color-shaded or AI_DEFAULT_TEXTURED_MATERIAL_NAME if they define a
     *  (dummy) texture. </li>

     * <li> at least one mesh must be there</li>
     * <li> there may be no meshes with 0 vertices or faces</li>
